# Non-Orthogonal-CDMA.matlab Repository

## Project Objective  
The primary objective of this project is to simulate, analyze, and understand the behavior 
of a shared channel access method in multi-user communication systems. 
Specifically, the project explores the performance of 
Non-Orthogonal CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) under both ideal and noisy channel conditions. 
The 2-PAM (Pulse Amplitude Modulation) scheme is employed as the simplest 
modulation technique to facilitate focused analysis.

## Motivation  
This project stems from an academic interest in telecommunications 
and shared medium access techniques. The work is driven by the need to 
deepen theoretical understanding and evaluate practical implications within an academic context. 
The repository serves as both a technical exploration and a tool for documenting findings related to this domain.

## Repository Structure  
The repository is organized into two main directories:

### 1. `DOCUMENTATION/`  
This directory contains the **CDMA_git.pdf**, which provides a functional description of the code, 
maps the theoretical model guiding the project, presents and analyzes 
the results of the simulations, and concludes with key findings. While not a scientific paper, 
the documentation is inspired by academic standards to present a structured analysis.  

### 2. `CODE/`  
This directory contains the source code written in MATLAB. 
The code implements the Non-Orthogonal CDMA simulations, focusing on 
the system's performance in both noisy and ideal environments using 2-PAM modulation.

## Scope of the Project  
This repository aims to:  
- Explore the theoretical and practical aspects of Non-Orthogonal CDMA.  
- Simulate the system to study its behavior under different channel conditions.  
- Provide structured documentation for the results and insights gained.  

For further details, refer to the **CDMA_git.pdf** in the `DOCUMENTATION/` directory or the source code in the `CODE/` directory.
